# Taka ðŸª™ ($TAKA)

Taka is a stablecoin loosely based on MakerDAO's DAI stablecoin.

## Features

- **Decentralization**: TAKA operates on a decentralized network, ensuring no single entity has control over the stablecoin.
- **Stability**: The value of TAKA is pegged to the Indian Rupee, offering stability and reducing volatility commonly associated with other cryptocurrencies.
- **Smart Contracts**: TAKA utilizes smart contracts on a blockchain to automate processes such as collateralization, liquidation, and governance.
- **Transparency**: All transactions and operations on the TAKA blockchain are transparent and verifiable through the blockchain's public ledger.

## How It Works

Taka maintains its peg to the INR through a system of over-collateralization. Users lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency assets as collateral, enabling the issuance of TAKA. The smart contracts governing the stablecoin automatically adjust collateralization ratios to maintain stability.
